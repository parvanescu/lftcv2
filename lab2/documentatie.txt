SymbolTable class:
Has generic data type.
Needs a type at initialization.

Fields:
    -> capacity: integer, represents the max number of linked lists in the st
    -> size: integer, represents the number of nodes added to st
    -> map: main data structure, a list with the starting node of a linked list on each position (or null if that linked list is empty)
Methods:
    -> put:
    returns: tuple of the form (bucketIndex,linkedListIndex) representing the position of the token in the hashmap
    params:
     - value: the value of the token
    description:
        adds a new value to a bucket, based on the hash value of the input parameter
    -> pos:
    returns: tuple of the form (bucketIndex, linkedListIndex) representing the position of the token in the hashmap
    params:
     - value: the value of the token
    description:
        returns the position of the token in hashmap or if it doesn't exist it adds it using the put method
    -> hashFunction
    returns: an integer representing the sum of the value of the ascii chars from the input parameter
    params:
    - value: the value of the token whom hash should be computed
    description: computes the sum of the value of the ascii chars from the input parameter
